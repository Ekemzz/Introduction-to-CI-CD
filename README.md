# Introduction-to-CI-CD

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** are DevOps practices that help teams deliver software faster, more reliably, and with fewer errors.

* **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  Developers frequently merge their code into a shared repository. Each change triggers automated builds and tests to ensure the new code works well with the existing system. This reduces bugs and integration issues.

* **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
  After CI, the application is automatically packaged and prepared for release. Deployments can be triggered manually, but the system is always in a deploy-ready state.

* **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
  Goes one step further â€” every successful change that passes CI tests is automatically deployed to production with no manual approval.

**Benefits of CI/CD:**

* Faster release cycles.
* Quick feedback on code quality.
* Reduced human errors in deployments.
* More confidence in changes through automation.

**Example tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: CI/CD automates code testing and delivery, making software development faster, safer, and more efficient.


**GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD tool built directly into GitHub. It lets you automate workflows (like building, testing, and deploying your code) every time certain events happen in your repository â€” for example, when you push code, open a pull request, or create a release.

* **Workflows:** Defined in YAML files inside `.github/workflows/`. A workflow describes what should run and when.
* **Jobs:** Each workflow is made up of jobs (like build, test, deploy).
* **Steps:** Each job contains steps that run commands or reusable **actions**.
* **Runners:** The actual environment (like Ubuntu, Windows, or macOS) where jobs execute.

**Benefits:**

* Integrated directly into GitHub (no extra setup needed).
* Supports CI/CD pipelines (build â†’ test â†’ deploy).
* Huge marketplace of pre-built actions (e.g., for Docker, AWS, Kubernetes).
* Works well with cloud providers and external services.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate software workflows without leaving GitHub.
