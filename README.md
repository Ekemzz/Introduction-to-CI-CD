# Introduction-to-CI-CD

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** are DevOps practices that help teams deliver software faster, more reliably, and with fewer errors.

* **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  Developers frequently merge their code into a shared repository. Each change triggers automated builds and tests to ensure the new code works well with the existing system. This reduces bugs and integration issues.

* **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
  After CI, the application is automatically packaged and prepared for release. Deployments can be triggered manually, but the system is always in a deploy-ready state.

* **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
  Goes one step further â€” every successful change that passes CI tests is automatically deployed to production with no manual approval.

**Benefits of CI/CD:**

* Faster release cycles.
* Quick feedback on code quality.
* Reduced human errors in deployments.
* More confidence in changes through automation.

**Example tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: CI/CD automates code testing and delivery, making software development faster, safer, and more efficient.


**GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD tool built directly into GitHub. It lets you automate workflows (like building, testing, and deploying your code) every time certain events happen in your repository â€” for example, when you push code, open a pull request, or create a release.

* **Workflows:** Defined in YAML files inside `.github/workflows/`. A workflow describes what should run and when.
* **Jobs:** Each workflow is made up of jobs (like build, test, deploy).
* **Steps:** Each job contains steps that run commands or reusable **actions**.
* **Runners:** The actual environment (like Ubuntu, Windows, or macOS) where jobs execute.

**Benefits:**

* Integrated directly into GitHub (no extra setup needed).
* Supports CI/CD pipelines (build â†’ test â†’ deploy).
* Huge marketplace of pre-built actions (e.g., for Docker, AWS, Kubernetes).
* Works well with cloud providers and external services.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate software workflows without leaving GitHub.

 6. the directory was initiatised, changes were staged and ready to push.
 <img width="805" height="469" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d4270fe-699f-47e7-8598-6a2cd4a3bea0" />

7. the workflow directory was created using "mkdir -p .github/workflows". and this editor "vim .github/workflows/node.js.yml
" was used to edit the file.

8. The changes were pushed and the actions section on the remote repo was evaluted for build status.

trouble shooting
1. The errors are trouble-shooted and the guide is below.

<img width="629" height="421" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1bb12d0-b61d-4c6a-bb70-15dd6e41bd12" />
the presence of package-lock.json is required for the build to progress. run npm install
<img width="821" height="459" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b4f207e-a718-438a-bd49-4e9255f5d2ba" />

2. <img width="959" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b33346e6-bf52-4883-9be7-4400593715b1" />
modify package.json file and edit the test script
<img width="833" height="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c1efbc-9ca3-4696-883f-41e27a688de3" />

3. create index.test.js so that jest script can use it.
<img width="792" height="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52e58f35-459e-44eb-8beb-1f3afef9e1d4" />

4. ran test by using npm test
<img width="660" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a8ff004-b4ba-4553-97f9-28115f65e49e" />
added the files that had changes as well as the test.js file and pushed to remote repo
<img width="736" height="437" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60d318e9-c361-4ef7-af00-108c2067428b" />

5. the node.js.yml file was updated and pushed to the main branch. build was succesful
   <img width="956" height="449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d34c31f9-8177-4dd5-9c58-5d4d3973c8ad" />

What happened here is:

By removing 14.x from the workflow matrix, you avoided the incompatibility issue between Node 14 and Jest 29+.

Your workflow is now only testing in environments where your code and dependencies are supported.

âœ… So your project is:

Building successfully

Running tests automatically via GitHub Actions

Verifying consistency on Node 16 and 18

Thatâ€™s exactly what a proper CI/CD setup should look like.
